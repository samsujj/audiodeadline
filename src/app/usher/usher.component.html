            <h2>works his magic in our studio!</h2>
          </div>

        <p><span class="spanwhite">Usher has sold 23.8 million albums and 38.2 million digital songs in the United States.</span><br>To date, his worldwide sales stand at 43 million albums and 75 million records overall, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Usher has won numerous awards and accolades including 18 Billboard Music Awards and 8 Grammy Awards. Usher was also a coach on NBC's The Voice in Season 4 and 6. Whether you are Usher's number one fan, or you are just getting to love him, you won't want to miss this once in a lifetime chance to watch him work live. This experience will certainly not disappoint.<br><br>Usher's music is generally R&B, but also dynamically incorporates pop amongst other genres. His artistry brings out <span class="spanpurple">"the best of pop music in R&B"</span>. Contextually, his narratives often have an autobiographical nature of emphasis on lifestyle, relationships and love, often personifying himself as "an R&B Casanova". His albums have been said to contain influences of soul and hip hop, touches of '80s rock guitar and the minimal rhythm of '80s hip hop, and displays extreme versatility. He has even took a country road when he covered <span class="spanyellow">"Neon Lights" by Blake Shelton, his rival coach on The Voice</span>. This just goes to show you that you never know what User will come up with, and you now have a chance to participate in a live creation. Get on Audio Deadline, or wish you had… for the rest of your life.</p>
